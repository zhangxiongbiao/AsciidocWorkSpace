[NOTE]
.This document is under active development and discussion!
====
If you find errors or omissions in this document, please don’t hesitate to
{url-issue}[submit an issue or open a pull request]with a fix.
We also encourage you to ask questions and discuss any aspects of the project on the
{mail-list}[mailing list] or {IRC}[IRC]. New contributors are always welcome!
====

This manual assumes you are using Asciidoctor to produce and render your document.
Asciidoctor implements more syntax, attributes and functions than the legacy AsciiDoc.py processor.
<<asciidoctor-vs-asciidoc,Appendix A>> lists which features are available to the Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors.


= Introduction to Asciidoctor
[TIP]
.Discuss and Contribute
Use {url-issues}/433[Issue 433] to drive development of this section. Your contributions make a difference. No contribution is too small.

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax,
then feeds the parse tree into a set of built-in templates to produce HTML5, PDF, DocBook 5, etc.
You have the option of writing your own converter or providing {url-tilt}[Tilt]-supported
templates to customize the generated output or produce alternative formats.

== What is Asciidoctor?

[NOTE]
Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python processor (`asciidoc.py`). The Asciidoctor test suite has > 1,500 tests to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.
In addition to the standard AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., [x-]`icon:fire[]`) and UI elements (e.g., [x-]`button:[Save]`).

=== Compared to AsciiDoc
[TIP]
.Discuss and Contribute
Use {url-issues}/434[Issue 434] to drive development of this section. Your contributions make a difference. No contribution is too small.

= Quick Starts
== Installation Quick Start
[TIP]
.Discuss and Contribute
Use {url-issues}/436[Issue 436] to drive development of this section.
Your contributions make a difference. No contribution is too small.

== Usage Quick Start
[TIP]
.Discuss and Contribute
Use {url-issues}/436[Issue 437] to drive development of this section. Your contributions make a difference. No
contribution is too small.

===  Using the Command Line Interface
Asciidoctor’s command line interface (CLI) is a drop-in replacement for the asciidoc.py command from the
Python implementation.

If the Asciidoctor gem installed successfully, the asciidoctor command line interface (CLI) will be available on
your PATH. To confirm that Asciidoctor is available, execute:

 $ asciidoctor -version

The following information should be output in your terminal:

 Asciidoctor 0.1.4 [http://asciidoctor.org]

To invoke Asciidoctor from the CLI and render an .adoc file, execute:
----
$ asciidoctor <asciidoc_file>
----

This will use the built-in defaults for options and create a new file in the same directory as the input file, with the same base name, but with the .html extension.

There are many other options available and full help is provided via:

 $ asciidoctor -help

or in the {uri-man}[man page].
There is also an asciidoctor-safe command, which turns on safe mode by default, preventing access to files
outside the parent directory of the source file. This mode is very similar to the safe mode of asciidoc.py .

=== Using the Ruby API
In addition to the command line interface, Asciidoctor provides a Ruby API. The API is intended for integration with
other software projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.
[TIP]
Asciidoctor also has a Java AIP that mirrors the Ruby API. The Java API class through to the Ruby API using an embedded
JRuby runtime.See the {uri-jruby}[Asciidcotor Java integration project] for more information.

To use Asciidoctor in your application, you first need to require the gem:
[source,ruby]
 require `asciidoctor`

With that in place, you can start processing AsciiDoc documents. To parse a file into an Asciidoctor::Document
object:
[source,ruby]
 doc = Asciidoctor.load_file 'sample.adoc'


= Getting Started
[NOTE]
Some Pending

== System Requirements
Asciidoctor works on Linux, Mac and Windows. +

Asciidoctor requires one of the following implementations of Ruby:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby 2.0 (or better)
* JRuby 1.7.5 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* JRuby 9000
* Rubinius 2.0 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* Opal (Javascript)

We expect Asciidoctor to work with other versions of Ruby as well. We welcome your help testing those versions if
you are interested in seeing them supported.

== Installing the Asciidoctor Ruby Gem
Asciidoctor can be installed via the `gem` command, bundler, or popular Linux package managers.

To install Asciidoctor using the `gem` command:

. Open a terminal.
. Type the `gem` command.

 $ gem install asciidoctor


If the Asciidoctor gem installed successfully, the `asciidoctor` command line interface (CLI) will be available on
your PATH. To confirm that Asciidoctor is available, execute:

 $ asciidoctor --version


.Two API Flavors
****
In addition to the CLI, Asciidoctor provides a Ruby API. The API is intended for integration with other software
projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.
Asciidoctor also has a Java API that mirrors the Ruby API. The Java API calls through to the Ruby API using an
embedded JRuby runtime. See the Asciidoctor Java integration project for more information.
****

===  Install with Bundler

===  Install with `yum`
. Open the terminal
. Run the installation command

Fedora 21 or earlier::
+
$ sudo yum install asciidoctor

Fedora 22 or later::
+
$ sudo dnf install asciidoctor

=== Install with +apt-get+

= Terms and Concepts
All of the content in an Asciidoctor document, including lines of text, predefined styles, and processing commands,
is classified as either a block or an inline element. Within each of these elements are an array of styles, options, and
functions that can be applied to your content.

This section will provide you with an overview of what each of these elements and sub-elements are and the basic
syntax and rules for using them.

== Elements
One or more lines of text in a document are defined as a block element. Block elements can be nested within block
elements.

A document can include the following block elements:

* Header
* Title
* Author Info
* First Name
* Middle Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Revision Info
* Attribute Entry
* Title
* Second Body

== Macros
[TIP]
.Discuss and Contribute
Use {url-issue}/443[Issue 443] to drive development of this section. Your contributions make a difference. No
contribution is too small.

== Formatting marks

=== Constrained quotes
.When the word stand alone
 That is *strong* stuff

That is *strong* stuff

.When there are multiple words
 That is *really strong* stuff!

That is *really strong* stuff!

.When the word is adjacent to punctuation
 This stuff sure is *strong*!

This stuff sure is *strong*!

=== Unconstrained quotes
In short, "`unconstrained`" means anywhere, including *within* a word.

.Unconstrained formatting
She spells her name with an "`h`", as in Sara**h**.

"```endpoints```"
"`endpoints`"

"```张三```"

== Attributes

:name: zxb
{name}

:name!: // unset attribute
{name}

.Separating Lists
****
If you have adjacent lists, they have the tendency to want to fuse together. To force the lists apart, place a line comment between them (//), offset on either side by a blank line (i.e., an end of list marker). Here’s an example, where the ^ is dummy text that indicates this line serves as an "end of list" marker:

====
* Apples
* Oranges

//^

* Walnuts
* Almonds

.Possible DefOps manual locations
* West wood maze
** Maze heart
*** Reflection pool
** Secret exit
* Untracked file in git repository
====
****

== Complex Paragraph

====
* The header in AsciiDoc is optional, but if
it is used it must start with a document title.

* Optional Author and Revision information
immediately follows the header title.

* The document header must be separated from
  the remainder of the document by one or more
  blank lines and cannot contain blank lines.

The basis for this documentation germinated when I awoke one morning and was confronted by the dark and stormy eyes of the chinchilla.
She had conquered the mountain of government reports that, over the course of six months, had eroded into several minor foothills and a creeping alluvial plain of loose papers.
