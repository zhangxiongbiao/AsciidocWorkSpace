[[breaking_23_index_apis]]
=== Mappings

==== Limit to the number of `nested` fields

Indexing a document with 100 nested fields actually indexes 101 documents as each nested
document is indexed as a separate document. To safeguard against ill-defined mappings
the number of nested fields that can be defined per index has been limited to 50.
This default limit can be changed with the index setting `index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`.
Note that the limit is only checked when new indices are created or mappings are updated. It
will thus only affect existing pre-2.3 indices if their mapping is changed.

[[breaking_23_scripting]]
=== Scripting

==== Groovy dependencies

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, the Groovy scripting capabilities
depended on the `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all` artifact.  In addition
to pulling in the Groovy language, this pulls in a very large set of
functionality, none of which is needed for scripting within
Elasticsearch. Aside from the inherent difficulties in managing such a
large set of dependencies, this also increases the surface area for
security issues. This dependency has been reduced to the core Groovy
language `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy` artifact.
