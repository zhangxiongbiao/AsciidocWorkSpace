== Deck.js Backend for Asciidoctor

The {backend-git}[Deck.js backend] for Asciidoctor is a collection of Haml templates that transform an AsciiDoc document to HTML 5-based slides animated by {deckjs-org}[Deck.js].

=== Ruby Gem Requirements

The Asciidoctor Deck.js backend requires the following Ruby gems:

* asciidoctor
* tilt
* haml

To determine what gems are installed on your system, open a terminal window and type:
 
 $ gem list --local

A list of installed gems will be returned.

If you're missing the `asciidoctor`, `tilt`, or `haml` gems, install them from the command-line with `gem install`.

 $ gem install asciidoctor tilt haml

To learn more about installing the Asciidoctor toolchain, read the {install-ref}[Installing the Toolchain] or {install-mac-ref}[Installing Asciidoctor on Mac OS X] guides.

=== Backend and Deck.js Installation

. Download or `git clone` the {backend-git}[asciidoctor-deck.js] repository.

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-deck.js

. Create a directory named `deck.js` inside your working directory (i.e. where your AsciiDoc document resides).

. {deckjs-zip}[Download] and extract the Deck.js archive or `git clone` the {deckjs-git}[Deck.js] repository into the `deck.js` directory you created in step 2.

 $ git clone git://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js.git

. If you plan to split your slides, {decksplitjs-git}[download the `deck.split.js` extension] and extract it into the `deck.js/extensions/split` directory.

. If you want to add the blank screen control, {deckblankjs-git}[download the `deck.js-blank` extension] and extract it into the `deck.js/extensions/blank` directory.

. If you want to use the fullscreen photo feature, create an `images` directory in your working directory.

=== Document Attributes

There are a number of document attributes specific to the `deckjs` backend.

.`deckjs` backend document attributes
[cols="2,1,2m"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Example

|:backend: deckjs
|Activates the Deck.js backend to render the document as a Deck.js presentation
|:backend: deckjs

|:deckjs_theme: <theme>
|Sets the Deck.js theme to neon, swiss or web-2.0
|:deckjs_theme: web-2.0

|:deckjs_transition: <type>
|Sets the transition style to horizontal-slide, vertical-slide or fade
|:deckjs_transition: fade

|:customjs: <javascript location>
|Sets a custom javascript file; can be used as a Deck.js custom configuration
|:customjs: <javascript location>

|:customcss: <css location>
|Sets a custom css file
|:customcss: <css location>

|:blank:
|Registers the third-party blank module for toggling the visibility of the slide using the kbd:[b] key
|:blank:

|:goto:
|Opens a floating control when the kbd:[g] key is pressed to advance to a specific slide
|:goto:

|:menu:
|Toggle to and from a grid layout overview of all the slides by pressing the kbd:[m] key
|:menu:

|:navigation:
|Renders clickable previous and next navigation icons on the slides
|:navigation:

|:status:
|Renders the current slide number and total number of slides at the bottom of each slide
|:status:

|:split:
|Registers the third-party split module for use in the presentation
|:split:

|:toc:
|Includes a table of contents that can be toggled by pressing the kbd:[t] key
|:toc:
|===

NOTE: You can also specify a custom stylesheet using the `stylesheet` attribute, which customizes AsciiDoc elements like section, paragraph, images, etc.
Learn more about the `stylesheet` attribute in the guide {factory-ref}[How do I use the Asciidoctor stylesheet factory to produce custom themes?]

The attributes described in the table above are set in the header of your document.

.Header with `deckjs` backend attributes
....
= Presentation Title
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:deckjs_theme: web-2.0
:deckjs_transition: horizontal-slide
:navigation:
....

=== Slide Syntax Examples

Structuring a slideshow and writing the slide content uses the same syntax as a typical AsciiDoc document, with a few added features.

Let's see some examples of the `deckjs` backend features:

.Slide titles and background images
----
= Title of Presentation <1>
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:deckjs_transition: fade
:navigation:

== Title of Slide One <2>

This is the first slide after the title slide.

[canvas-image=images/example.jpg] <3>
== Slide Two's Title will not be displayed <4>

[.canvas-caption, position=center-up] <5>
This text is displayed on top of the example.jpg image.
----
<1> The presentation title and author's name will be displayed on the title slide.
<2> Each new slide is designated by a level 1 section title (`==`).
<3> The `canvas-image` attribute embeds a fullscreen image as a slide background. Position the attribute above the title of the slide you want the image applied to.
<4> When the `canvas-image` attribute is applied to a slide, that slide's title will not be displayed.
<5> `canvas-caption` applies a colored box around the caption text. `position` specifies the location of the caption block (bottom-left, top-left, bottom-right, top-right, center-up, center-down)

.Stepped paragraphs, lists, and blocks
----
== Stepped paragraphs

[%step]
This paragraph is displayed first.

[%step]
Then this paragraph is displayed when the _Next_ arrow is clicked.

== Stepped list items

[%step]
* A bullet is displayed each time the _Next_ arrow is clicked.
* B
* C

== Stepped blocks

[%step]
--
Block one
--

[%step]
--
Block two
--
----

The `step` option reveals each paragraph, bullet, etc. separately each time you click the _Next_ arrow.

WARNING: The original AsciiDoc `deckjs` backend for the AsciiDoc processor used the option `incremental` instead of `step`. 
We've changed it to `step` in order to save you some typing.

.Split
----
= Presentation Title
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:split: <1>

== This Slide is Split

This Slide will act like

<<< <2>

three individual slides with the same title

<<<

once the document is rendered.
----
<1> To create multiple, consecutive slides with the same title, set the `split` attribute in the document header.
<2> Then, within a slide, insert `<<<` to specify the slide breaks.

=== Rendering

To render your presentation as HTML5, execute the command:

 $ asciidoctor -T ../asciidoctor-deck.js/templates/haml presentation.adoc

. The command `-T` (`+--template-dir+`) tells the Asciidoctor processor to override the built-in converter.
. Directly after `-T` is the path to where you saved or cloned the asciidoctor-deck.js repository containing the templates for the `deckjs` backend (step 1 under the <<backend-and-deck-js-installation,installation section>>).  

Further information about rendering documents with Asciidoctor is available in the guide {render-ref}[How do I render a document?]
