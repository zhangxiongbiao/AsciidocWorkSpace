The `discrete` attribute can be applied to any section titles that start with two to six equal signs (`==`).
A discrete title is styled like a section title but is not part of the content hierarchy (i.e., it ignores section nesting rules).
Nor will it be included in the ToC.

NOTE: You can also use the `float` attribute to create a discrete title.
However, the content in the discrete section will not be repositioned (i.e., float) to the left or right of other content blocks.
