=== Markdown-style horizontal rules

Asciidoctor recognizes Markdown horizontal rules.
The motivation here is to ease migration of Markdown documents to AsciiDoc documents.

To avoid conflicts with AsciiDoc's block delimiter syntax, only 3 repeating characters (`-` or `+*+`) are recognized.
As with Markdown, whitespace between the characters is optional.

A macro definition for the Markdown horizontal rules is included in the AsciiDoc compatibility file so they can be recognized by the `asciidoc` command as well.
