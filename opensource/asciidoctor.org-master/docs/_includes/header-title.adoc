A document title must be placed on the first line of the document.
It is preceded by one equal sign followed by at least one space (`=`), and then the text of the title.

Here's an example of a document title followed by an abbreviated paragraph.

When `doctype` is set to `article` or `manpage`, a document can have only one section level 0 title.
The `book` document type can have multiple section level 0 titles.
The first section level 0 title, located in the header, is the document's title, and subsequent section level 0 titles are considered the titles of parts.

A document's title is assigned to the built-in `doctitle` attribute.
Its value is identical to the value returned by `Document#doctitle` and `sect0`.
The doctitle attribute can be referenced anywhere in a document and displays the document's title when rendered.

You can control whether or not the title is displayed when the document is rendered with the attributes `notitle` and `showtitle`.
If you don't want the title to be rendered, set the `notitle` attribute in the header or CLI.
On the other hand, the title is not displayed when a document's header and footer are disabled.
The header and footer are disabled when a document is embedded.
In this case, set the `showtitle` attribute in order to render the title.

Let's see how to add additional information to the header, including an author and her email address.
