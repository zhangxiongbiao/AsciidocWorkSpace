Asciidoctor uses CSS for HTML document styling and JavaScript for generating document attributes such as a table of contents and footnotes.
It comes bundled with a fresh, modern stylesheet, named `asciidoctor.css`.
When you generate a document with the `html5` backend, the asciidoctor.css stylesheet is embedded into the HTML output by default.

However, you can link to the stylesheet instead of embedding it.
To have your document link to the default stylesheet, set the `linkcss` attribute in the document's header.

include::mysample-link.adoc[]
----

You can also set linkcss with the CLI.

 $ asciidoctor -a linkcss mysample.adoc

Now, when you view the directory, you should see the file asciidoctor.css in addition to `mysample.adoc` and `mysample.html`.
The linkcss attribute automatically copies asciidoctor.css to the output directory.
Additionally, you can inspect mysample.html in your browser and see `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./asciidoctor.css">` inside the `<head>` tags.

If you don't want any styles applied to the HTML output of your document, unset the `stylesheet` attribute.

 $ asciidoctor -a stylesheet! mysample.adoc

One of Asciidoctor's strengths is the ease in which you can swap the default stylesheet for an <<user-manual#stylesheet-factory,alternative Asciidoctor theme>> or use your own <<user-manual#custom-themes,custom stylesheet>>.
