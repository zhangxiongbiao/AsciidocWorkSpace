=== Left or right column layout
// tag::column[]
The TOC can be positioned in a column to the left or right of the document's content by assigning the `left` or `right` value to the toc attribute.
The column is scrollable and fixed.

// NOTE: Setting `:toc: left` is equivalent to using the original AsciiDoc +toc2+ attribute.
// end::column[]

// How does the toc-position attribute fit into this section?

=== Manual placement
// tag::place[]
The `macro` value on the toc attribute allows you to place the TOC anywhere in your document.
To control where the TOC is rendered in your document, set the toc attribute to `macro`.
Then, within the body of your document, use the `+toc::[]+` block macro to indicate the TOC's location.

.Setting toc value to macro and using the +toc::[]+ macro
----

----
<1> The toc attribute must be set to macro in order to enable the use of the +toc::[]+ macro.
<2> In this example, the +toc::[]+ macro is placed below the first section's title, indicating that this is the location where the TOC will be displayed once the document is rendered.

Asciidoctor also has a `toc-placement` attribute, that when set with a value of `preamble` places the TOC below the preamble.
You do not need to include the +toc::[]+ block macro in the document when using the preamble value.

If you set toc-placement but don't assign it a value, the TOC will be placed in the document's header by default.

CAUTION: The `toc-placement` and `toc-position` attributes are mutually exclusive.
