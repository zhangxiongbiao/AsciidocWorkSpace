If you need to get technical in your writing, Asciidoctor integrates with {uri-mathjax}[MathJax].
MathJax is the standard library for displaying Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) expressions in the browser.

Thanks to {uri-mathjax}[MathJax JavaScript library], Asciidoctor supports both {uri-asciimath}[AsciiMathML] and {uri-latexmath}[TeX and LaTeX] math notation in the same document.

== Activating stem support

To activate equation and formula support, simply set the `stem` attribute in the document's header (or by passing the attribute to the commandline or API).

.Setting the stem attribute
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=base-co]
----
<1> The default interpreter value, `asciimath`, is assigned implicitly.

By default, Asciidoctor's stem support assumes all equations are AsciiMath if not specified explicitly.
If you want to use the LaTeX interpreter by default, assign `latexmath` to the stem attribute.

.Assigning an alternative interpreter to the stem attribute
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=base-alt]
----

TIP: You can still use both interpreters in the same document.
The value of the `stem` attribute merely sets the default interpreter.
To set the interpreter explicitly for a given block or inline span, just use `asciimath` or `latexmath` in place of `stem` as explained in <<Using multiple stem interpreters>>.

Stem content can be displayed inline with other content or as discrete blocks.
No substitutions are applied to the content within a stem macro or block.

// end::intro[]

=== Inline stem content

// tag::in[]
The best way to mark up an inline formula is to use the `stem` macro.

.Inline stem macro syntax
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=in-co]
----
<1> The inline stem macro contains only one colon (`:`).
<2> Place the content you want interpreted within the square brackets (`[]`) of the macro.

.Rendered inline stem content
====
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=in]
====
// end::in[]

=== Block stem content

// tag::bl[]
Block formulas are marked up by assigning the `stem` style to a delimited passthrough block.

.Delimited stem block syntax
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=bl-co]
----
<1> Assign the stem style to the passthrough block.
<2> A passthrough block is delimited by a line of four consecutive plus signs (`++++`).

The result is rendered beautifully in the browser thanks to MathJax!

.Rendered delimited stem block
====
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=bl]
====

TIP: You don't need to add special delimiters around the expression as the {uri-mathjax-docs}[MathJax documentation] suggests.
Asciidoctor handles that for you automatically!

// end::bl[]

=== Using multiple stem interpreters

// tag::inter[]
You can use multiple interpreters for stem content within the same document by using the interpreter's name instead of the default `stem` name.

For example, if you want LaTeXMath to interpret an inline equation, name the macro `latexmath`.

.Inline latexmath macro syntax
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=multi-l]
----

.Rendered latexmath content
====
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=multi-l]
====

The name that maps to the interpreter you want to use can also be applied to block stem content.

.Delimited asciimath block syntax
[source]
----
include::ex-stem.adoc[tags=multi-a]
----

// end::inter[]

Since it's just a pass through block wrapped in a dedicated template (HTML and DocBook) and a JavaScript library in HTML, it shouldn't be too hard to implement.

Inline delimited (implemented)

```
$$`sqrt(4) = 2`$$
```


I decided to use `\$` as the delimiter for AsciiMath. That way, we can be confident it isn't going to match where it shouldn't. While this introduces some complexity in the raw form:

```
\$sqrt(4) = 2\$

or

$$\$Cu^(2+)\$$$
```

Alternatively, you can use an inline delimiter.


\$sqrt(4) = 2\$
<3> The asciimath inline delimiter is a backslash and a dollar sign (`\$`).
<4> Place the formula between a set of the asciimath inline delimiters.
<5> The latexmath inline delimiter is a backslash and a dollar sign (`\$`).
