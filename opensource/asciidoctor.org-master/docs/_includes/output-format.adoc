The Asciidoctor processor parses an AsciiDoc document and converts it to a variety of formats, including HTML, DocBook and PDF.
The processor produces the output format by using a backend that you specify with the `-b` (`--backend`) command line option.
If no backend is indicated, the processor uses the default backend (`html5`).

Asciidoctor has four native backends.

`html5`:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.
Asciidoctor's default backend.
`xhtml5`:: XHTML 5 markup.
`docbook`:: DocBook XML 5.0 markup.
`docbook45`:: DocBook XML 4.5 markup.

It also has several backends that can be plugged in.

`manpage`:: Manual pages for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
`pdf`:: Portable Document Format (PDF).
`deckjs`:: Deck.js slideshow.
