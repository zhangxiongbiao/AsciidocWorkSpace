// tag::intro[]
The style attribute is the first positional attribute in an attribute list.
It specifies a predefined set of characteristics that should apply to a block element or macro.

For example, a paragraph block can be assigned one of the following built-in style attributes:

* normal (default, so does not need to be set)
* literal
* verse
* quote
* listing
* TIP
* NOTE
* IMPORTANT
* WARNING
* CAUTION
* abstract
* partintro
* comment
* example
* sidebar
* source

// end::intro[]

==== Id
// tag::id[]
The id attribute specifies a unique name for an element.
That name can only be used once in a document.

An id has two purposes:

. to provide an internal link or cross reference anchor for the element
. to reference a style or script used by the output processor
// end::id[]

===== Block assignment
// tag::bl[]
In an attribute list, there are two ways to assign an id attribute to a block element.

. Prefixing the name with a hash (`#`).
. Specifying the name with `id=<name>`.

Let's say you want to create a blockquote from an open block and assign it an id and role.
You prepend the style `quote` to the `#` (`id`) in the first attribute position, as this example shows:

[quote#think, Donald Trump]
____
As long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big.

TIP: The order of id and role values in the shorthand syntax does not matter.
// end::bl[]

===== Inline assignment
// tag::in[]
The id (`#`) shorthand can be used on inline quoted text.
