An abstract is a concise overview of an article.
Typically found in the frontmatter of academic, research, and analytical papers, an abstract can be classified as structured or unstructured and complete or limited.
Abstracts with subheadings are structured abstracts, whereas abstracts without subheadings are unstructured.
A complete (informative) abstract states the key topics and findings of the paper while a limited (descriptive) abstract briefly describes the structure of the article.
An abstract title is not necessary.
