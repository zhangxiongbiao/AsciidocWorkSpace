// tag::intro[]
Sections partition the document into a content hierarchy.
In Asciidoctor, sections are defined using section titles.

A section title represents the heading for a section.
Section title levels are specified by two to six equal signs.
The number of equal signs represents the nesting level (using a 0-based index) of the title.

.Render section titles
====
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=b-base]
====

TIP: In addition to the equals sign marker used for defining single-line section titles, Asciidoctor recognizes the hash symbol (+#+) from Markdown.
That means the outline of a Markdown document will render just fine as an AsciiDoc document.

Section levels must be nested logically.
There are two rules you must follow:

. A document can only have multiple level 0 sections if the +doctype+ is set to +book+.
. Section levels cannot be skipped when nesting sections (i.e., you can't nest a level 5 section directly in a level 3 section)

For example, the following syntax is illegal:

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=bad]
----

Content above the first section title is designated as the document's preamble.
Once the first section title is reached, content is associated with the section it is nested in.

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=content]
----

// end::intro[]

=== Titles as HTML headings
// tag::heading[]
When the document is rendered as HTML 5 (using the built-in `html5` backend), each section title becomes a heading element where the heading level matches the number of equal signs.
For example, a level 1 section (`==`) maps to an `<h2>` element.
// end::heading[]

=== Auto-generated IDs
// tag::autoid[]
Section IDs are generated from the section title.
By default, the ID is prefixed with an underscore (`+_+`) and each word in the title is separated by an underscore.
You can change the prefix using the `idprefix` attribute.

[source]
----
:idprefix: -
----

If you want to remove the prefix, assign it to an empty value:

[source]
----
:idprefix:
----

You can change the word separator by using the `idseparator` attribute.

[source]
----
:idseparator: -
----

To disable the auto-generation of section IDs, unset the `sectids` attribute:

[source]
----
:sectids!:
----

IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor permits all valid UTF-8 characters in section IDs.
If you are generating a PDF from AsciiDoc using a2x and dblatex, see http://aerostitch.github.io/misc/asciidoc/asciidoc-title_uft8.html[Using UTF-8 titles with a2x] to learn about the required `latex.encoding=utf8` switch.

// end::autoid[]

=== Custom IDs
// tag::custom-id[]
You can also assign a custom ID and reference text label to a section (see <<anchordef>>).
This can be useful when you define a cross reference pointing to the section.

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=with-anchor]
----
// end::custom-id[]

////
NOTE:: Custom IDs and reference text labels will override autogenerated IDs and reference text.
////

=== Links
// tag::link[]
To turn section titles into links, enable the `sectlinks` attribute.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet displays linked section titles with the same color and styles as unlinked section titles.
// end::link[]

=== Anchors
// tag::anchor[]
When the `sectanchors` attribute is enabled on a document, an anchor (empty link) is added before the section title.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet renders the anchor as a section entity (`&sect;`) that floats to the left of the section title.
// end::anchor[]

=== Numbering
// tag::number[]
Asciidoctor allows section numbering to be toggled on and off throughout a document.
You can enable section numbers using the `sectnums` attribute.

[source]
----
:sectnums:
----

NOTE: Asciidoctor still supports the attribute name `numbered` to number sections for backward compatibility with AsciiDoc Python, but the name `sectnums` is preferred.

You can also use this attribute entry above any section title in the document to toggle the auto-numbering setting.
When you want to turn off the numbering, add an exclamation point to the end of the attribute name:

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=num-off]
----

For regions of the document where section numbering is turned off, the section numbering will not be incremented.

Given:

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=num]
----

The sections will be numbered as follows:

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=num-out]
----

Asciidoctor will always curtail incrementing the section number in regions of the document where section numbers are off.

If `sectnums` is set on the command line (or API), that overrides the value set in the document header, but it does not prevent the document from toggling the value for regions of the document.

If `sectnums!` is set on the command line (or API), then the numbers are disabled regardless of the setting within the document.

.Flexible attributes
NOTE: The `sectnums` attribute is referred to as a "`flexible attribute`", which means it can always be changed midstream in the document, even if it is enabled through the API or CLI.
At the time of writing, `sectnums` is unique in this way, though other attributes may receive this special status in the future.

==== Numbering depth

You can restrict section numbering depth by defining the `sectnumlevels` (document header-only) attribute.

[source]
----
include::ex-section.adoc[tags=sectnuml]
----
<1> When the `sectnumlevels` attribute is assigned a value of `2`, section titles with levels 3 through 5 are not numbered (i.e., not prefixed with a number).

Assigning `sectnumlevels` a value of `0` is effectively the same as disabling section numbering (i.e., `sectnums!`).
// end::number[]
