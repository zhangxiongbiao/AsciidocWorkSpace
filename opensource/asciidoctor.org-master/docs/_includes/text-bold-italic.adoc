- user-manual: text formatting: Bold and italic
////

The two most common ways of emphasizing a word is to format it as bold or italic.
To render a word or phrase with bold styling, place an asterisk (`{asterisk}`) at the beginning and end of the text you wish to format.
To bold a letter or letters in a string of text, place two asterisks (`{asterisk}{asterisk}`) before and after the letter or letters.

Letters and words are italicized using one (`{underscore}`) or two (`{underscore}{underscore}`) underscores.
When you want to bold and italicize a letter or word, the bold markup must be the outermost markup.
