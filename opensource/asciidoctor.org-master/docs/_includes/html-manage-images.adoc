=== Managing images

This document is included in render-documents and the user-manual.
////

Images are not embedded in the HTML output by default.
If you have image references in your document, you'll have to save the image files in the same directory as your rendered document.
Or, by passing the `data-uri` attribute to the processor, you can embed the images into the document.

To embed images into the HTML output, set data-uri on the command line or in the document's header.

 $ asciidoctor -a data-uri mysample.adoc
