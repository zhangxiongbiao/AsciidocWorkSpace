Custom Themes
Creating a theme

This document is included in:

You can create your own themes to apply to your documents.

Themes go in the [path]'sass/' folder.
To create a new theme, let's call it +hipster+, start by creating two new files:

[path]'sass/hipster.scss'::
  * Imports the theme settings, which includes default variables and resets
  * Imports the AsciiDoc components
  * Defines any explicit customization

[path]'sass/settings/_hipster.scss'::
  * Sets variables that customize Foundation 4 and the AsciiDoc CSS components

Here's a minimal version of [path]'sass/hipster.scss':

[source,scss]
----
@import "settings/hipster";
@import "components/asciidoc";
@import "components/awesome-icons";
----

NOTE: You don't have to include the underscore prefix when importing files.

NOTE: The +awesome-icons+ component is only applicable to HTML generated by Asciidoctor > 0.1.2 with the +icons+ attribute set to +font+.

You can add any explicit customization below the import lines.

The variables you can set in [path]'sass/settings/_hipster.scss' are a combination of the {factory-ref}/blob/master/sass/settings/_settings.scss.dist[Foundation 4 built-in global settings] and {factory-ref}/blob/master/sass/settings/_defaults.scss[global settings and imports for the AsciiDoc components].

Once you've created your custom theme, it's time to apply it to your document.
