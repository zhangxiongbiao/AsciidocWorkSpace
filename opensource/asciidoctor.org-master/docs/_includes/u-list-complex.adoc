Aside from nested lists, all of the list items you've seen only have one line of text.
A list item can hold any type of AsciiDoc content, including paragraphs, listing blocks and even tables.
You just need to _attach_ them to the list item.

Like with regular paragraph text, the text in a list item can wrap across any number of lines, as long as all the lines are adjacent.
The wrapped lines can be indented and they will still be treated as normal paragraph text.
For example:

[source]
----
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=indent]
----

====
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=indent]
====

TIP: When items contain more than one line of text, leave a blank line before the next item to make the list easier to read.

If you want to attach additional paragraphs to a list item, you "`add`" them together using a _list continuation_.
A list continuation is a `{plus}` symbol on a line by itself, immediately adjacent to the two blocks it's connecting.
Here's an example:

[source]
----
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=cont]
----

====
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=cont]
====

Using the list continuation, you can attach any type of block element and you can use the list continuation any number of times in a single list item.

Here's an example that attaches both a listing block and an admonition paragraph to the first item:

[source]
....
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=complex]
....

Here's how the source is rendered:

.A list with complex content
====
include::ex-u-list.adoc[tags=complex]
====
