=== Include files relative to a common source directory

This content is included in the user manual

Asciidoctor expands attributes in the target of the include directive.
That means you only have to type the unique part of the path when linking to a source file.

Example:

[source]
....
:sourcedir: src/main/java

[source,java]
----
\include::{sourcedir}/org/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor.java[]
----
....

The target of the include resolves to:

 src/main/java/org/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor.java
