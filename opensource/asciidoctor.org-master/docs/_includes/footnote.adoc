A footnote is created with the footnote macro (`+footnote:[]+`).
If you plan to reference a footnote more than once, use the ID footnote macro (`+footnoteref:[]+`).

<1> Insert the footnote macro directly after any punctuation. Note that the footnote macro only uses one colon.
<2> Insert the footnote's content within the square brackets of the macro. The text may span several lines.
<3> The first time you enter a footnote you want to reuse, give it a unique ID in the first position.
<4> Separate the ID from the footnote text with a comma. Do not enter a space between the comma and the footnote text.
<5> The next time you reference the footnote you only need to insert the ID in the square brackets.

When rendered, the footnotes will be numbered consecutively throughout the article.
