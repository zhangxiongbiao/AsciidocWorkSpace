To include an image on its own line (i.e., a _block image_), use the `image` prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it.

[source]
----
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=base]
----

====
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=base]
====

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:

[source]
----
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=alt]
----

You can also give the image an id, a title, set its dimensions and make it a link.

[source]
----
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=attr-co]
----
<1> ID, see <<anchordef>>.
<2> The title of a block image is displayed underneath the image when rendered.
<3> The first positional attribute, _Sunset_, is the image's alt text.
<4> Image width and height
<5> `link` makes the image a link

.A hyperlinked image with caption
====
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=attr]
====

Block images are prefixed by a caption label (Figure) and number automatically.
To turn off figure caption labels and numbers, add the `figure-caption` attribute to the document header and unset it.

 :figure-caption!:

.Automatic image scaling
****
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet implements responsive images (using width-wise scaling).
If the width of the screen is smaller than the width of the image, the image will be scaled down to fit.
To support this feature, the original aspect ratio of the image is preserved at all sizes.
Thus, when you set the dimensions, the values should reflect the original aspect ratio of the image as this will be enforced.
If the values don't match the aspect ratio, the height is ignored by the browser.
****

If you want to include an image inline, use the `image` prefix instead (notice there is only one colon):

[source]
----
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=in]
----

====
include::ex-image.adoc[tags=in]
====

For inline images, the optional title is displayed as a tooltip.
