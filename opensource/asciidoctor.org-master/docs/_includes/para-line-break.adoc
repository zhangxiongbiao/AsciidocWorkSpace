Since adjacent lines of text are combined into a single paragraph when Asciidoctor renders a document, that means you can wrap paragraph text or put each sentence or phrase on a separate line.
The line breaks won't appear in the output.

However, if you want the line breaks in a paragraph to be preserved, you can either use a plus sign (`{plus}`) or the `hardbreaks` attribute.
This results in a visible line break (e.g., `<br>`) folowing each line.

Alternatively, you can preserve line breaks throughout your whole document by adding the `hardbreaks` attribute to the document's header.

You can also preserve line breaks using <<user-manual#literal-text-and-blocks,literal blocks>>, <<user-manual#listing-blocks,listing blocks>>, and <<user-manual#verse,verses>>.
