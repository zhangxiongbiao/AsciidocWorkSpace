We are looking for feedback on these macros before setting them in stone.
If you have suggestions, we want to hear from you!

IMPORTANT: You *must* set the `experimental` attribute to enable these macros.

=== Keyboard shortcuts

Asciidoctor recognizes a macro for creating keyboard shortcuts using the syntax +kbd:[key(+key)*]+.

You no longer have to struggle to explain to users what keys they are supposed to press.

=== Menu selections

Trying to explain to someone how to select a menu item can be a pain.
With the `menu` macro, the symbols do the work.

=== UI buttons

It can be equally difficult to communicate to the reader that they need to press a button.
They can't tell if you are saying "`OK`" or they are supposed to look for a button labeled *OK*.
It's all about getting the semantics right.
The `btn` macro to the rescue!
