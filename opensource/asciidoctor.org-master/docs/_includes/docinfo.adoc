You can add custom content to the header or footer of a document with document information (`docinfo`) files.
The docinfo file's content and file extension depends on whether the source document's output is HTML or DocBook.

=== Create a docinfo file

When the source document will be rendered to HTML, the docinfo file can contain the elements allowed in an HTML `<HEAD>` section, including:

* `<base>`
* `<link>`
* `<meta>`
* `<noscript>`
* `<script>`
* `<style>`
* `<title>`

As seen in the example below, docinfo files are useful for storing metadata, stylesheet, and script information.
Note that you do not need to include the `<head>` tag, nor is the `<title>` tag required.

.A docinfo file for HTML output
[source,html]
----
<meta name="keywords" content="open source, documentation">
<meta name="description" content="The dangerous and thrilling adventures of an open source documentation team.>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="basejump.css">
<script src="map.js"></script>
----

Docinfo files for HTML output must be saved with the `.html` file extension.

When DocBook 5.0 is the rendered output, the docinfo file may include any of the {docbook-info-ref}[<info> element's 48 children], such as:

* `<address>`
* `<copyright>`
* `<edition>`
* `<keywordset>`
* `<publisher>`
* `<subtitle>`

The following example shows some of the content a docinfo file for DocBook might contain.

.A docinfo file for DocBook 5.0 output
[source,xml]
----
<author>
  <personname>
    <firstname>Karma</firstname>
    <surname>Chameleon</surname>
  </personname>
  <affiliation>
    <jobtitle>Word SWAT Team Leader</jobtitle>
  </affiliation>
</author>

<keywordset>
  <keyword>open source</keyword>
  <keyword>documentation</keyword>
  <keyword>adventure</keyword>
</keywordset>

<printhistory>
  <para>April, 2019. Twenty-sixth printing.
  </para>
</printhistory>
----

Docinfo files for DocBook output must be saved with the `.xml` file extension.

=== Docinfo attributes and file names

To add content from a docinfo file to the header of a rendered document:

. The docinfo file must be named correctly
. The appropriate docinfo attribute must be set in the source document

How you name your docinfo file and the docinfo attribute you set in your source document depends on whether you want to add content to:

[loweralpha]
. a specific document
. all the documents in a directory
. a and b

The attributes and the corresponding file names are listed in the table below.

.Docinfo attributes and file names
|===
|Attribute |Purpose |docinfo file name for HTML |docinfo file name for DocBook

|docinfo
|Add content to a specific document
|`<docname>-docinfo.html`
|`<docname>-docinfo.xml`

|docinfo1
|Add content to all documents in the same directory
|`docinfo.html`
|`docinfo.xml`

|docinfo2
|Add content from either docinfo file
|`<docname>.html`, `<docname>-docinfo.html`
|`<docname>.xml`, `<docname>-docinfo.xml`
|===

Let's apply the information above to an example exercise.

You have two AsciiDoc documents, adventure.adoc and insurance.adoc, saved in the same folder.
You want to add the same content to the headers of both documents when they're rendered to HTML.

. Create a docinfo file using <head> elements.
. Save the docinfo file as docinfo.html.
. Set the `docinfo1` attribute in adventure.adoc and insurance.adoc.

You also want to include some additional content to the header of adventure.adoc.

. Create *another* docinfo file using <head> elements.
. Save the docinfo file as adventure-docinfo.html.
. Set the `docinfo` attribute in adventure.adoc.
. Alternatively, you could remove the docinfo1 attribute and set docinfo2 instead.

=== Footer docinfo files

Footer docinfo files are differentiated from header docinfo files by adding `-footer` to the file name.
In the HTML output, the footer content is inserted immediately after the footer div (that is, `<div id="footer">`).
In the DocBook output, the footer content is inserted immediately before the ending `</article>` or `</book>` element.

.docinfo
If you want additional footer content for a specific document, put the content in the file `<docname>-docinfo-footer.html` (for HTML output) or `<docname>-docinfo-footer.xml` 
(for DocBook output), where `<docname>` is the name of the document without the AsciiDoc extension.
Then set the attribute `docinfo` in the source document.

.docinfo1
If you want additional footer content for all documents in the same directory, put the content in the file `docinfo-footer.html` or `docinfo-footer.xml`.
Then set the attribute `docinfo1` in the source document.

.docinfo2
If you want the document to look for either docinfo file, set the attribute `docinfo2` in the source document.

TIP: To change the text in the "Last updated" line in the footer, set the text in the attribute `last-update-label` (for example, `:last-update-label: <your text> Last Updated`). +
To disable the "Last updated" line in the footer, unassign the attribute `last-update-label` (however, this leaves an empty footer div). +
To disable the footer completely, set the attribute `nofooter`. Then having a footer docinfo file effectively replaces the default footer with your custom footer.

=== Attribute substitution

Docinfo files can include attribute references.

For example, if you created the following docinfo file:

.Docinfo file containing a revnumber attribute reference
[source,xml]
----
<edition>{revnumber}</edition>
----

And this source document:

.Source document including a revision number
----
= Document Title
Author Name
v1.0, 2013-06-01
:doctype: book
:backend: docbook
:docinfo:
----

Then the rendered DocBook output would be:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="5.0" lang="en">
  <info>
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <date>2013-06-01</date>
    <author>
      <personname>
        <firstname>Author</firstname>
        <surname>Name</surname>
      </personname>
    </author>
    <authorinitials>AN</authorinitials>
    <revhistory>
      <revision>
        <revnumber>1.0</revnumber> <!--1-->
        <date>2013-06-01</date>
        <authorinitials>AN</authorinitials>
      </revision>
    </revhistory>
  </info>
</book>
----
<1> The revnumber attribute reference was replaced by the source document's revision number in the rendered output.
