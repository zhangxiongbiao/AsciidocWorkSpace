Tables are one of the most refined areas of the AsciiDoc syntax.
They are easy to create, easy to read in raw form and also remarkably sophisticated.

Tables are delimited by `|===` and made up of cells.
The default table data format is PSV (Prefix Separated Values), which means that the processor creates a new cell each time it encounters a vertical bar (`|`).
The cells are grouped into rows.
Each row must share the same number of cells, taking into account any <<user-manual#cell,column or row spans>>.
Then, each consecutive cell in a row is placed in a separate column.
The simple table example below consists of two columns and three rows.

.Simple table
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-co]
----
<1> The table's content boundaries are defined by a vertical bar followed by three equal signs (`|===`).
<2> A blank line separates the table delimiter and the first row so the first row is not styled as the table's header.
<3> The new cell is marked by a vertical bar (`|`).
<4> Rows are separated by blank lines.

.Result: Rendered simple table

Like with all blocks, you can add a role to a table using the `role` attribute.
The role attribute becomes a CSS class when converted to HTML.
The preferred shorthand for assigning the role attribute is to put the role name in the first position of the block attribute list prefixed with a `.` character, as shown here:

----
[.rolename]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base]
----

Leading and trailing spaces around cell content is stripped and, therefore, don't affect the table's layout when rendered.
The two examples below illustrate how leading and trailing spaces don't change the rendered table's layout.

.Cell content adjacent to the |
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=cell1]
----

.Result: Rendered table when cell content was entered adjacent to the |
[width="90"]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=cell1]

.Cell content with varying leading and trailing spaces
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=cell2]
----

.Result: Rendered table when cell content was bounded by varying leading and trailing spaces
[width="90"]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=cell2]

There are multiple ways to group cells into a row.
The cells in a row can be placed on:

[loweralpha]
. the same line
. consecutive, individual lines
. a combination of a and b

.Cells on the same line
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=same]
----

.Result: Rendered table when multiple cells where entered on the same line
[width="90"]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=same]

When the cells of a row are individually entered on consecutive lines, the `cols` attribute is needed to specify the number of columns in the table.
If the `cols` attribute is not set, the first non-blank line inside the block delimiter (`|===`) determines the number of columns.

.Cells on consecutive, individual lines
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=indv-co]
----
<1> The `cols` attribute states that this table has three columns. The `*` is a repeat operator which is explained in the <<user-manual#cols-format,column specifiers>> section.

.Result: Rendered table when cells where listed on consecutive, individual lines
[width="90"]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=indv]

Rows can be formed from adjacent lines of individual cells and cells listed on the same line.

.Cells on the same line and individual lines
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=same-indv]
----

.Result: Cells on the same line and individual lines
[width="90"]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=same-indv]

The next sections describe and demonstrate the variety of ways you can customize table cells, rows and columns.
