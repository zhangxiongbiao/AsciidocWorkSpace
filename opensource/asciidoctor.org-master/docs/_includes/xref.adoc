In Asciidoctor, the xref inline macro is used to create cross references (i.e. links) to sections, blocks or phrases that have an ID (explicit or auto-generated).

An implicit cross reference is created by enclosing the ID of the target block or section (or the path of another document with an optional anchor) in double angled brackets.

====
include::ex-xref.adoc[tags=base]
====

You can also link to a block or section using the title by referencing its title.
However, the title must begin with an uppercase letter (in basic Latin) without any leading formatting marks.

Some converters, such as the HTML converter, will use the `xreflabel` as the default text of the link.
However, you can also customize this text.
After the ID, add a comma and then enter the custom text you want the cross reference to display.

You can also use the inline xref macro as an alternative to the double angled bracket form.
