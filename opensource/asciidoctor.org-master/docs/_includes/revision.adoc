A document's revision information contains three optional attributes.

[horizontal]
`revnumber`::
The document's version number which must contain at least one numeric character.
Any letters or symbols preceding the numeric character will not be rendered.
If the `revdate` is absent, the `revnumber` must be followed by a comma (e.g., `v1.0,`) or (as of Asciidoctor 1.5.3) begin with a "v" character (e.g., `v1.0`).
If the `revdate` is present, it must be separated from the `revnumber` by a comma.

`revdate`::
The date the document version was completed.
When the `revnumber` or `revremark` attributes are set, but `revdate` is not, then `revdate` will be assigned the `docdate` value.

`revremark`::
Information about this version of the document.

The revision information is listed on the third line of the header, beneath the author information line.

<1> revnumber and revdate must be separated by a comma (`,`).
<2> revdate can contain words, letters, numbers, and symbols.
<3> The revremark attribute must be preceded by a colon (`:`), regardless of whether revnumber or revdate are set.

When rendered, the revnumber in the byline is preceded by the word _Version_; however, when referenced in the body of the document, only the numerical value is displayed.
The `version-label` attribute controls the version number label in the byline.
The revision information attributes can also be explicitly set in the header.

include::ex-rev.adoc[tags=attr]
----
<1> When explicitly set, any characters preceding the version number are *not* dropped.
<2> The revremark can contain attribute references.
<3> The version-label attribute is unset so that the word _Version_ does not precede the revnumber in the byline.

.Result: Rendered revision information when revision attributes are explicitly set

In the rendered document, notice that the _V_ preceding the revnumber is capitalized in the byline but not when the attribute is referenced in the body of the document.

NOTE: Revision extraction information and an extraction example are pending.
