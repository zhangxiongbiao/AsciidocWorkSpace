You can define that some sections are appendix sections by adding the `[appendix]` marker before the section header.

----
[appendix]
== Copyright and License
----

Sections marked as appendix have different header, built as follow:

* A fixed prefix ("`Appendix`" is the default value)
* Letters are used to number the section (A, B, C...)
* A colon
* The section title

The prefix can be modified with the `appendix-caption` attribute.
It can be unset with:

[source]
----
: appendix-caption!:
----

Or set to a different value with
[source]
----
: appendix-caption: App
----

Appendix sections can be combined with subsections.
Example:

[source]
----
include::ex-appendix.adoc[tags=app]
----

The sections will be numbered as follows:

[source]
----
include::ex-appendix.adoc[tags=app-out]
----
