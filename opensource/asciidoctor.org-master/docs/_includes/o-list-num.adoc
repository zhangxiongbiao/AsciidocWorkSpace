For ordered lists, Asciidoctor supports the numeration styles such as lowergreek and decimal-leading-zero.

The full list of numeration styles that can be applied to an ordered list are as follows:

[cols="2,3", width="50%"]
.Asciidoctor ordered list numeration styles
|===
|Block style |CSS list-style-type

|arabic
|decimal

|decimal{ast}
|decimal-leading-zero

|loweralpha
|lower-alpha

|upperalpha
|upper-alpha

|lowerroman
|lower-roman

|upperroman
|upper-roman

|lowergreek{ast}
|lower-greek
|===
{ast} These styles are only supported by the HTML converters.

Here are a few examples showing various numeration styles as defined by the block style shown in the header row:

|===
|[arabic]{ast} |[decimal] |[loweralpha] |[lowergreek]

a|
. one
. two
. three

a|
[decimal]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[loweralpha]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[lowergreek]
. one
. two
. three
|===

{ast} Default numeration if block style is not specified

TIP: Custom numeration styles can be implemented using a custom role.
Define a new class selector (e.g., `.custom`) in your stylesheet that sets the `list-style-type` property to the value of your choice.
Then, assign the name of that class as a role on any list to which you want that numeration applied.

When the role shorthand (`.custom`) is used on an ordered list, the numeration style is no longer omitted.

You can override the number scheme for any level by setting its style (the first positional entry in a block attribute list).
You can also set the starting number using the `start` attribute:
