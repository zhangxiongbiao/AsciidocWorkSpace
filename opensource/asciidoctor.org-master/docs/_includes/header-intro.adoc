The document header contains title, author and revision information as well as any document-wide attributes set and defined by the user.
The header is _not required_ when the `doctype` is `article` or `book`.
If absent, Asciidoctor will render the content that is present.

WARNING: A header must be present when the document type is `manpage`.
The requirements for a manual page (man page) are described in the <<user-manual#man-pages,man pages>> section.

When the header is present, it must start with a document title.
The title can be immediately followed by two optional lines of text defining author and revision information.
Finally, any document-wide settings are configured using attribute entries.
The header can not contain any blank lines, but it can contain comments.

The header is processed when rendering a full document.
This means that the header of a document called via an <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> will be processed and rendered.
When you do not want the header of a document to be rendered, set the `noheader` or `no-header-footer` attribute in the document's header or the CLI.

.Front matter
****
Many static site generators, such as Jekyll and Middleman, rely on front matter added to the top of the document to determine how to render the content.
Asciidoctor has a number of attributes available to correctly handle front matter.
See the <<user-manual#static-website-generators,static website generators>> section to learn how Asciidoctor integrates with static website generators.

Now let's look at the document title in detail.
