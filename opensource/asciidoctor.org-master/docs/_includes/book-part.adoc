You can group the sections of your document into parts.
Parts can only be used when the `doctype` is `book`.
Part titles are specified with a single equals sign (`=`), the equivalent to a document title, i.e. section level 0.
After the part title, you can include an optional introduction, which is designated by the `partintro` attribute.

A part can also include its own preface, bibliography, glossary and index.
