One of the most interesting uses of AsciiDoc is for creating man pages (short for manual pages) for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
A man page conforms to a special document structure.
That structure is recognized by Asciidoctor, when the `doctype` attribute is set to `manpage`.
Additionally, Asciidoctor produces the same output when rendering a man page to HTML using the `html5` backend.

When reading an AsciiDoc document using the manpage doctype, Asciidoctor parses the following man page metadata:

* `mantitle`
* `manvolnum`
* `manname`
* `manpurpose`

The mantitle and manvolum are captured from the document title.
The manname and manpurpose are taken from the first section of the document, which must be a level 1 section and have content in the format `<manname> - <manpurpose>`.

Here's an example of a man page written in AsciiDoc:

```
= asciidoctor(1)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
asciidoctor - converts AsciiDoc source files...

== SYNOPSIS
*asciidoctor* ['OPTION']... 'FILE'...
```

From this document, Asciidoctor extracts the following man page-related attributes:

[horizontal]
`mantitle`:: asciidoctor
`manvolnum`:: 1
`manname`:: asciidoctor
`manpurpose`:: converts AsciiDoc source files...

Refer to {man-raw}[the AsciiDoc source of the Asciidoctor man page] to see a complete example.
The man pages for git are also produced from AsciiDoc documents, so you can use those as another example to follow.

The Asciidoctor Backends repository hosts an early draft of a {man-backend-git}[manpage backend], which is now used to generate the man page for Asciidoctor.
