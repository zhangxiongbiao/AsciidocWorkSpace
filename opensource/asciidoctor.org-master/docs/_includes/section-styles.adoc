Asciidoctor provides styles for the frontmatter and backmatter sections commonly found in journal articles, academic papers, and books.
The styles are:

* colophon
* abstract
* preface
* dedication
* part introduction
* appendix
* glossary
* bibliography
* index

These styles are available to the `article` and `book` document types, with the exception of the part introduction style which is exclusive to books.

In general, the section style attribute is set above a level 1 section title or block of text.
For instance, the example below shows how to label a section as an abstract.

----
[abstract]
== Documentation Abstract

Documentation is a distillation of many long, squiggly adventures.

The structure and usage rules for each section style is explained in <<structuring-navigating-and-referencing-your-content>>.
