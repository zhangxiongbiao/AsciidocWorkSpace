- user-manual: Running Asciidoctor Securely
////

Asciidoctor provides security levels that control the read and write access of attributes, the +include+ directive, macros, and scripts while a document is processing.
Each level includes the restrictions enabled in the prior security level.

[horizontal]
+UNSAFE+::
A safe mode level that disables any security features enforced by Asciidoctor.
Ruby is still subject to its own restrictions.
+
*This is the default safe mode for the CLI.*
Its integer value is +0+.

+SAFE+::
This safe mode level prevents access to files which reside outside of the parent directory of the source file.
It disables all macros, except the +include+ directive.
The paths to +include+ files must be within the parent directory.
It allows assets to be embedded in the document.
+
Its integer value is +1+.

+SERVER+::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from setting attributes that would affect the rendering of the document.
This level trims +docfile+ to its relative path and prevents the document from:
+
--
* setting +source-highlighter+, +doctype+, +docinfo+ and +backend+
* seeing +docdir+

It allows +icons+ and +linkcss+.

Its integer value is +10+.
--

+SECURE+::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from attempting to read files from the file system and including their contents into the document.
Additionally, it:
+
--
* disables icons
* disables the +include+ directive
* data can not be retrieved from URIs
* prevents access to stylesheets and JavaScripts
* sets the backend to +html5+
* disables +docinfo+ files
* disables +data-uri+
* disables +docdir+ and +docfile+
* disables source highlighting

Asciidoctor extensions may still embed content into the document depending whether they honor the safe mode setting.

*This is the default safe mode for the API.* Its integer value is +20+.

You can set Asciidoctor's safe mode level using the CLI or API.
