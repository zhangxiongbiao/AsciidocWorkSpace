- user-manual: Literal Text and Blocks

Literal paragraphs and blocks display the text you write exactly as you enter it.
Literal text is treated as preformatted text.
The text is shown in a fixed-width font and endlines are preserved.
Only <<user-manual#special-characters,special characters>> and callouts are replaced when the document is rendered.

Literal blocks are defined three ways:

. Indenting the first line of a paragraph by one or more spaces
. Applying the `literal` attribute to a paragraph or block
. Using the literal block delimiter (`\....` )

When a line begins with one or more spaces it is displayed as a literal paragraph.
This method is a quick and easy way to insert code snippets.

.Result: Implicit literal text

When you want an entire block of text to be literal and would prefer not to indent it, set the `literal` attribute on top of the element.

.Literal style paragraph syntax

.Result: Literal style paragraph

include::ex-literal.adoc[tags=para]

Finally, you can surround the content you want rendered as literal by enclosing it in a set of literal block delimiters (`\....`).
This method is useful when the content consists of several elements that are separated by blank lines.

.Literal delimited block syntax

include::ex-literal.adoc[tags=block]

Notice in the output that the bold text formatting is not rendered nor are the three, consecutive periods replaced by the ellipsis Unicode character.
