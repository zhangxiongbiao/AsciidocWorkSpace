HTML output section

== Using a command line tool

This document is included in render-documents and the user-manual.

In this section, we'll create a sample document, then process and render it with Asciidoctor's `html5` converter.

. Create an AsciiDoc file like the one below
. Save the file as `mysample.adoc`

----
include::mysample.adoc[]
----

To convert mysample.adoc to HTML from the command line:

. Open a console
. Switch to the directory that contains the mysample.adoc document
. Call the Asciidoctor processor with the `asciidoctor` command, followed by the name of the document you want to render

//^

 $ asciidoctor mysample.adoc

Remember, Asciidoctor's default converter is html5, so it isn't necessary to specify it with the `-b` command.

You won't see any messages printed to the console.
If you type `ls` or view the directory in a file manager, there is a new file named `mysample.html`.

 $ ls
 mysample.adoc  mysample.html

Asciidoctor derives the name of the output document from the name of the input document.

Open `mysample.html` in your web browser.
Your document should look like the image below.

====
image::mysample.png[]
====

The document's text, titles, and link is styled by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, which is embedded in the HTML output.
As a result, you could save mysample.html to any computer and it will look the same.
