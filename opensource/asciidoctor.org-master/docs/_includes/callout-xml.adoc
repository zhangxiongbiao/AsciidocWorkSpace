XML doesn't have line comments, so our "`tuck the callout behind a line comment`" trick doesn't work here.
To use callouts in XML, you must place the callout's angled brackets around the the XML comment and callout number.

Here's how it appears in a listing:

[source,subs=specialcharacters]
....
include::ex-callout.adoc[tags=source-xml]
....

Here's how it looks when rendered:

====
include::ex-callout.adoc[tags=source-xml]
====

Notice the comment has been replaced with a circled number that cannot be selected.
Now both you and the reader can copy and paste XML source code containing callouts without worrying about errors.
