=== Relative leveloffset

This content is included in the user manual

The `leveloffset` attribute is used to {uri-asciidoc-leveloffset}[shift the level of sections] when combining documents.
It works great for a single include level, but it quickly breaks down when you get into multiple levels of nesting.

The problem is that the level offset value is assumed to be absolute.
Asciidoctor now supports _relative_ level offset values using a leading + or - operator.

 :leveloffset: +1
 include::chapter-01.adoc[]
 :leveloffset: -1

Alternatively, you can specify the `leveloffset` attribute directly on the include directive so you don't have to worry about restoring the old value.

 include::chapter-01.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
