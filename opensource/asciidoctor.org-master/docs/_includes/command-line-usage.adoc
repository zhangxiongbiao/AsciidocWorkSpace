Command line usage quick start for Asciidoctor
This file is included in the install-toolchain and user-manual documents
////

Asciidoctor's command line interface (CLI) is a drop-in replacement for the +asciidoc.py+ command from the Python implementation. 

If the Asciidoctor gem installed successfully, the +asciidoctor+ command line interface (CLI) will be available on your PATH.
To confirm that Asciidoctor is available, execute:

 $ asciidoctor --version
 
The following information should be output in your terminal:

 Asciidoctor 0.1.4 [http://asciidoctor.org]
 
To invoke Asciidoctor from the CLI and render an +.adoc+ file, execute:

 $ asciidoctor <asciidoc_file>

This will use the built-in defaults for options and create a new file in the same directory as the input file, with the same base name, but with the +.html+ extension.

There are many other options available and full help is provided via:

 $ asciidoctor --help

or in the {uri-man}[man page].

There is also an +asciidoctor-safe+ command, which turns on safe mode by default, preventing access to files outside the parent directory of the source file. 
This mode is very similar to the safe mode of +asciidoc.py+.
