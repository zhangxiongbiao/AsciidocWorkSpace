Asciidoctor can produce DocBook 5.0 and 4.5 output.
Since the AsciiDoc syntax was designed with DocBook output in mind, the conversion is very good.
There's a corresponding DocBook element for each markup in the AsciiDoc syntax.

To convert the `mysample.adoc` document to DocBook 5.0 format, call the processor with the backend flag set to `docbook`.

 $ asciidoctor -b docbook mysample.adoc

A new XML document, named `mysample.xml`, will now be present in the current directory.

 $ ls
 mysample.adoc  mysample.html  mysample.xml

Here's a snippet of the XML generated by the DocBook converter.

[TIP]
====
The `xmlns` attribute is now added to the root DocBook element by default.
Set the attribute `noxmlns` to disable this feature.
====

If you're on Linux, you can view the DocBook file with {uri-yelp}[Yelp].

 $ yelp mysample.xml

And of course, if you're using the Asciidoctor Ruby API, you can generate a DocBook document directly from your application.

.Generate DocBook output from the API
[source,ruby]

Asciidoctor.convert_file('mysample.adoc', :in_place => true,
    :backend => 'docbook')

By default, the docbook converter produces DocBook 5.0 output that is compliant to the DocBook 5.0 specification.

A summary of the differences are as follows:

* XSD declarations are used on the document root instead of a DTD
* `<info>` elements for document info instead of `<articleinfo>` and `<bookinfo>`
* elements that hold the author's name are wrapped in a `<personname>` element
* the id for an element is defined using an `xml:id` attribute
* `<link>` is used for links instead of `<ulink>`
* the URL for a link is defined using the `xlink:href` attribute

Refer to {uri-docbook5}[What's new in DocBook v5.0?] for more details about how DocBook 5.0 differs from DocBook 4.5.

If you need to output DocBook 4.5, set the backend to `docbook45`.

 $ asciidoctor -b docbook45 sample.adoc
