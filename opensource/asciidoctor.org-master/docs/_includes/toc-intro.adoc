A table of contents (TOC) is a list of section and nested subsection titles that is generated when Asciidoctor processes a document.
The TOC is inserted directly below the document's title and author, titled _Table of Contents_, and lists the section 1 and section 2 level titles by default.

When the `docbook` converter is used, a TOC is inserted by default.
To include a TOC when using the `html` or a custom backend, you must set the `toc` attribute.
The toc attribute can be specified via the command line (`-a toc`) or in the document's header (`:toc:`)

.TOC enabled via the CLI
----
$ asciidoctor -a toc adventure.adoc

.TOC enabled via the document's header
----
include::toc.adoc[]

When the `toc` attribute is set, a TOC is inserted directly below the title and author in the rendered document.
