////

In addition to the command line interface, Asciidoctor provides a Ruby API.
The API is intended for integration with other software projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.

TIP: Asciidoctor also has a Java API that mirrors the Ruby API.
The Java API calls through to the Ruby API using an embedded JRuby runtime.
See the {java}[Asciidoctor Java integration project] for more information.
