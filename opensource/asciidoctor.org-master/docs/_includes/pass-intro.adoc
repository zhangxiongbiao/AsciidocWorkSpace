Passthroughs are the "`anything goes`" mechanism in Asciidoctor.
As its name implies, a passthrough passes its contents directly to the output document.
The contents of a passthrough are excluded from all <<user-manual#subs,substitutions>>.

WARNING: Using passthroughs to pass content without processing can couple your document to a specific output format, such as HTML.
In these cases, you can use conditional preprocessor directives to declare passthrough markup for each backend you need to support.
