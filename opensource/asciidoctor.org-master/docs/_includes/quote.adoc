// tag::intro[]
Prose excerpts, quotes and verses share the same syntax structure, including:

* block name, either `quote` or `verse`
* name of who the content is attributed to
* biblographical information of the book, speech, play, poem, etc., where the content was drawn from
* excerpt text
// end::intro[]

// tag::basic[]
For content that doesn't require the preservation of line breaks, set the `quote` attribute in the first position of the attribute list.
Next, set the attribution and relevant citation information.
However, these positional attributes are optional.
