- user-manual: Source Code Syntax Highlighting
////

Listing blocks and paragraphs are commonly used to display source code.
For this reason, Asciidoctor has enabled several syntax highlighting libraries, including CodeRay, highlight.js, Prettify, and Pygments, that you can use to style source code.

To enable syntax highlighting in a document, set the `source-highlighter` attribute in the <<user-manual#doc-header,document header>>.
If you set the attribute in the document, it _must_ be defined in the document header.

----
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: <value>
----

For example:

----
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: coderay
----

See the following table for possible values of the `source-highlighter` attribute.

To apply highlighting to source code, you must assign the `source` name and a source language to a paragraph or delimited block.
You can also set the source language globally using the `source-language` attribute.

[listing]
.Code block with title and syntax highlighting
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-base-co]
....
<1> An optional ID can be added to the block. See <<anchordef>>.
<2> Assign the block name `source` to the first position in the attribute list.
<3> Assign a source language to the second position.
<4> An optional title can be added to the block.
<5> The source block name is typically assigned to listing and literal blocks.

.Result: Source block with title and syntax highlighting
====
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-base]
====

.Source paragraph
----
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-para-co]
----
<1> Place the attribute list directly on the paragraph
<2> Once an empty line is encountered the syntax highlighting is unset.

.Result: Source paragraph
====
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-para]
====

If the majority of your source blocks use the same source language, you can set the `source-language` attribute in the document header and assign a language to it.

[listing]
.Source language attribute
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-lang]
....

Additionally, you can use an <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> to insert source code into an AsciiDoc document directly from a file.

[listing]
.Code block inserted from another file
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-inc]
....

TIP: Syntax highlighting is not disabled if an explicit `subs` attribute is used on a source listing as long as `specialcharacters` is in the subs list.
