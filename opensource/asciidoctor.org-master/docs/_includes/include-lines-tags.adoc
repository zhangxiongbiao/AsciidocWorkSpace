=== Selecting parts of a document to include

- User manual
////

The include directive supports extracting portions of content from within a document.
The content is specified either by user defined tags or a range of line numbers.

When including multiple line ranges or multiple tags, the individual values can be separated either by a comma or a semi-colon.
If commas are used, then the entire attribute value must be enclosed in quotes.
Using the semi-colon as the data separator alleviates this requirement.

==== By tagged regions

Tags are useful when you want to display specific regions of content from an include file instead of all of its content.
You can select tagged regions of content with the `tag` macro and the `tags` attribute.
The example below shows how you tag a region of content inside a file containing multiple code examples.

.Tagged code snippets in a file named core.rb
[source,ruby]
----
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=tag-co]
----
<1> To indicate the start of a tagged region, insert a comment line in the code.
<2> Assign a unique name to the tag macro. In this example the tag is called _timings_.
<3> Insert another comment line where you want the tagged region to end.
<4> Assign the name of the region you want to terminate to the `end` macro.
<5> This is the start a tagged snippet named _parse_.
<6> This is the end of the tagged snippet named _parse_.

IMPORTANT: The `tag::[]` and `end::[]` directives should be placed after a line comment as defined by the language of the source file.
The directives must also appear at the _end_ of the line.
In the previous example, we choose to prefix the lines with a hash (`#`) because that's the start of a line comment in Ruby.

In the next example, the tagged region named _parse_ is called by the `include` directive.

.Calling the _parse_ code snippet from a document
[source]
....
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=target-co]
....
<1> In the directive's brackets, set the `tag` attribute and assign it the unique name of the code snippet you tagged in your code file.

You can include multiple tags from the same file.

.Calling the _timings_ and the _parse_ code snippets from a document
[source]
....
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=target-co-multiple]
....

It is also possible to have fine-grained tagged regions inside larger tagged regions.

For example, if your include file has the following content:

[source]
----
// tag::snippets[]
// tag::snippet-a[]
snippet a
// end::snippet-a[]

// tag::snippet-b[]
snippet b
// end::snippet-b[]
// end::snippets[]
----

And you include this file using the following include directive:

[source]
----
\include::file-with-snippets.adoc[tag=snippets]
----

The following lines will be selected and displayed:

[source]
----
snippet a

snippet b
----

Notice that none of the lines with the tag directives are displayed.

NOTE: for XML files you can use the `+<!-- tag::name[] -->+` and `+<!-- end::name[] -->+` delimiters

Alternately, you can select content by line number.

==== By line ranges

To include content by a line or line range, assign a numerical value to the `lines` attribute.

[source]
----
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=line]
----

Multiple ranges can be specified as well.
Using a comma as separator.

[source]
----
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=m-line-comma]
----

Other example using semi-colons (no need to quote the `lines` attribute value).

[source]
----
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=m-line]
----

You can refer to the last line of the document in the range using the value -1.

[source]
----
include::ex-include.adoc[tags=last]
----
