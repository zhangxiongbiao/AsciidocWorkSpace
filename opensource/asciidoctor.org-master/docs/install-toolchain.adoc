// Bruce Wolfe bwolfe@redhat.com 2013-04-26 Issue #284 - Asciidoctor update instructions

// A new introduction that introduces and ties together all the elements in the chain (installing gem, text editors, previewer) needs to be created eventually.

Asciidoctor, an implementation of the AsciiDoc processor written in Ruby, is a drop-in replacement for AsciiDoc in most cases.
Asciidoctor provides a command line tool and a Ruby API for converting AsciiDoc documents to HTML 5, Docbook 5.0, DocBook 4.5 and custom output formats.

NOTE: To convert your document to PDF, you'll need to use the new {fopub-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub tool].
Directions for using the tool are documented in the {fopub-doc-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub README].

== System Requirements

include::{includedir}/install-upgrade-asciidoctor.adoc[tags=systemreq]

== Installing the Asciidoctor RubyGem

include::{includedir}/install-upgrade-asciidoctor.adoc[tags=basicgem]

.Two API Flavors
****
In addition to the CLI, Asciidoctor provides a {api}[Ruby API].
The API is intended for integration with other software projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.

Asciidoctor also has a Java API that mirrors the Ruby API.
The Java API calls through to the Ruby API using an embedded JRuby runtime.
See the {java}[Asciidoctor Java integration project] for more information.
