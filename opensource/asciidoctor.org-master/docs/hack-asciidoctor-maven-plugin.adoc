The {repo-ref}[Asciidoctor Maven plugin] is the official means of using Asciidoctor to render your {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] documentation using {maven-ref}[Apache Maven].
This guide teaches you how to hack on it.

For help running this plugin, review the {maven-guide-ref}[How do I install and use the Asciidoctor Maven plugin guide].

== Hacking

Developer setup for hacking on this project isn't difficult. 
The requirements are:

* Java
* Maven 3

All the other dependencies will be brought in by Maven. 
You should be able to use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Netbeans without any issue for hacking on the project.

== Building

Standard Maven build:

 $ mvn clean install

== Testing

{spock-ref}[Spock] is used for testing the calling of the Mojo. 
This will be downloaded by Maven. 
Tests are run simply by:

 $ mvn clean test

Or any of the other goals which run tests. 
If I can figure out a good way to setup a Ruby testing environment I'll do that as well, but none exists at this time.
