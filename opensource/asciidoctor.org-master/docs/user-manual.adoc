This manual assumes you are using Asciidoctor to produce and render your document.
Asciidoctor implements more syntax, attributes and functions than the legacy AsciiDoc.py processor.
<<asciidoctor-vs-asciidoc,Appendix A>> lists which features are available to the Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors.

////
== Navigating this document

The first sections define the general concepts and terms used by Asciidoctor
Next, each Asciidoctor feature, its capabilities, and how it can be customized is reviewed.
And when applicable, the feature's attributes and options are summarized in a table at the section's end.

=== Asciidoctor's most notable benefits

include::{includedir}/benefits.adoc[]

==== AsciiDoc syntax processing

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree into a set of built-in templates to produce HTML5, PDF, DocBook 5, etc.
You have the option of writing your own converter or providing {uri-tilt}[Tilt]-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce alternative formats.

NOTE: Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python processor (`asciidoc.py`).
The Asciidoctor test suite has > 1,500 tests to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.

In addition to the standard AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., [x-]`icon:fire[]`) and UI elements (e.g., [x-]`button:[Save]`).
Asciidoctor also offers a modern, responsive theme based on {uri-foundation}[Foundation] to style the HTML5 output.

.What is AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is two things:

. A mature{empty}footnote:[AsciiDoc is over 10 years old. It was first introduced in 2002.], plain-text format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.
. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called _backends_), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub{empty}footnote:[There are two implementations of the AsciiDoc processor. The original processor, named AsciiDoc, is written in Python. A more modern implementation, named Asciidoctor, is written in Ruby.].

AsciiDoc belongs to the family of {markup-ref}[lightweight markup languages], the most renowned of which is {markdown-ref}[Markdown].
AsciiDoc stands out from this group because it supports all the structural elements necessary for drafting articles, technical manuals, books, presentations and prose.
In fact, it's capable of meeting even the most advanced publishing requirements and technical semantics.


Serving as testament of this fact, many O'Reilly authors, including https://github.com/matthewmccullough[Matthew McCullough], https://github.com/tlberglund[Tim Berglund], https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-erlang[Simon St.Laurent] and http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg], have used AsciiDoc to write their books for that iconic technical library.

From the very beginning, AsciiDoc was designed to be a shorthand replacement for http://www.docbook.org/whatis[DocBook], one of the formats AsciiDoc can generate.
AsciiDoc can also produce beautiful HTML 5, PDFs, eBooks, man pages and even slide decks.
It has you covered from first draft to publishing.

.Two API Flavors
****
In addition to the CLI, Asciidoctor provides a <<api,Ruby API>>.
The API is intended for integration with other software projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.

Asciidoctor also has a Java API that mirrors the Ruby API.
The Java API calls through to the Ruby API using an embedded JRuby runtime.
See the {java}[Asciidoctor Java integration project] for more information.

= Terms and Concepts

[partintro]
--
All of the content in an Asciidoctor document, including lines of text, predefined styles, and processing commands, is classified as either a block or an inline element.
Within each of these elements are an array of styles, options, and functions that can be applied to your content.

This section will provide you with an overview of what each of these elements and sub-elements are and the basic syntax and rules for using them.

===== Block assignment

include::{includedir}/attr-style.adoc[tags=bl]

===== Inline assignment

include::{includedir}/attr-style.adoc[tags=in]

==== Role

NOTE: Section introduction pending

An element can be assigned numerous roles.

===== Block assignment

In an attribute list, there are two ways to assign a role attribute to a block element.

. Prefixing the name with a dot (`.`).
. Specifying the name with `role=<name>`.

[source]
----
[.summary]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

[source]
----
[role="summary"]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

To specify multiple roles using the shorthand syntax, separate them by dots.

[source]
----
[.summary.incremental]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

[source]
----
[role="summary,incremental"]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

===== Inline assignment

The role (`.`) shorthand can be used on inline quoted text.

.Quoted text with role assignments using traditional AsciiDoc syntax
----
[big goal]*free the world*
----

.Quoted text with role assignments using Asciidoctor shorthand
----
[.big.goal]*free the world*
----

TIP: The attribute list preceding formatted text can be escaped using a backslash (e.g., `+[role]*bold*+`).
In this case, the text will still be formatted, but the attribute list will be unescaped and output verbatim.

.Role-playing for text enclosed in backticks
To align with other formatted (i.e., quoted) text in AsciiDoc, roles can now be assigned to text enclosed in backticks.

Given:

```
[rolename]`escaped monospace text`
```

the following HTML is produced:

```html
<code class="rolename">escaped monospace text</code>
```

Using the shorthand notation, an id (i.e., anchor) can also be specified:

```
[#idname.rolename]`escaped monospace text`
```

which produces:

```html
<a id="idname"></a><code class="rolename">escaped monospace text</code>
```

Keep in mind that text enclosed is not subject to other inline substitutions, but rather passed through as is.

==== Options

The options attribute is a versatile named attribute that can contain a comma separated list of values.

It can also be defined globally with an attribute entry.

===== Block assignment

In an attribute list, there are three ways to assign an options attribute to a block element.

. Prefixing the value with a percent sign (`%`).
. Specifying the value with `opts=<name>`
. Specifying the value with `options=<name>`.

Consider a table block with the three option values `header`, `footer`, and `autowidth`.

Here's how the options are assigned to the table using the shorthand notation (`%`).

.Shorthand Asciidoctor syntax
----
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
| Cell A | Cell B
|===
----

Here's how the options are assigned to the table using `options`.

.Traditional AsciiDoc syntax
----
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
| Cell A | Cell B
|===
----

Let's consider the options when combined with other attributes.

.Shorthand Asciidoctor block syntax
----
[horizontal.properties%step]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----

.Traditional AsciiDoc block syntax
----
[horizontal, role="properties", options="step"]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----

=== Assigning document variables inline

Document variables can be assigned using the following syntax:

 {set:<attrname>[!][:<value>]}

For example:

[source]
{set:sourcedir:src/main/java}

It's effectively the same as:

 :sourcedir: src/main/java

This is important for being able to assign document attributes in places where attribute entry lines are not normally processed, such as in a table cell.

////
An example of where this might be used is documented in the {doc-variable-ref}[how to set the background color of a table cell] tip.

==== Nesting blocks and passthrough macros

When you're using passthroughs inside literal and listing blocks, it can be easy to forget that the triple-plus, double-dollar, and backtick passthroughs are macros.
If you want to enable the passthroughs, make sure to assign the +macros+ value to the +subs+ attribute.

Conversion from AsciiDoc to PDF is made possible by a number of tools.

{uri-asciidoctor-pdf}[Asciidoctor PDF]:: A native PDF converter for Asciidoctor (converts directly from AsciiDoc to PDF using Prawn).
+
Instructions for installing and using Asciidoctor PDF are documented in the project's {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-readme}[README].
The tool provides built-in theming via a YAML configuration file, which is documented in the {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-theming-guide}[theming guide].
+
TIP: Asciidoctor PDF is the preferred tool for converting to PDF and is fully supported by the Asciidoctor community.

a2x:: A DocBook toolchain frontend provided by that AsciiDoc Python project.
+
To use this tool, you should first convert to DocBook using Asciidoctor, then convert the DocBook to PDF using a2x.
a2x accepts a DocBook file as input and can convert it to a PDF using either Apache FOP or dblatex.
Instructions for using a2x are documented in the project's {uri-a2x-manpage}[man page].

{fopub-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub]:: A DocBook toolchain frontend similar to a2x, but which only requires Java to be installed on your machine.
+
Instructions for using asciidoctor-fopub are documented in the project's {fopub-doc-ref}[README].
To alter the look and feel of the PDF, it's necessary to pass XSL parameters or modify the XSLT.
More information about customization can be found in http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/[DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide].

= Customizing Your Output

[partintro]
--
Asciidoctor provides a default stylesheet and built-in converters so you can quickly process and render your document, but it also lets you use custom stylesheets and converters.
The Asciidoctor project includes alternative stylesheet themes from <<stylesheet-factory,the stylesheet factory>> and <<slideshows,specialized backends>>, such as the <<deckjs,Deck.js backend>>.
You can also create your own <<custom-themes,themes>> and <<custom-backends,backends>>.

=== Generate an HTML document

include::{includedir}/factory-gen.adoc[]

=== External preview

include::{includedir}/factory-preview.adoc[]

== Slideshows

The conversion to HTML-based slides is handled by a custom backend.
The backends usually requires that you adhere to a set of conventions to define a slide and its content.
But there's nothing in that content that restricts the document from being converted to a regular HTML page or PDF.

The first backend created was the one for deck.js.
Asciidoctor has backends for generating dzslides and reveal.js presentations as well.
Backends for other presentation frameworks are in the works.

[[deckjs]]
=== Deck.js

The {backend-git}[deck.js backend] for Asciidoctor is a collection of Haml templates that transform an AsciiDoc document to HTML 5-based slides animated by {deckjs-org}[deck.js].

==== Gem requirements

The Asciidoctor deck.js backend requires the following gems:

* asciidoctor
* tilt
* haml

To determine what gems are installed on your system, open a terminal window and type:

 $ gem list --local

A list of installed gems will be returned.

If you're missing the +asciidoctor+, +tilt+, or +haml+ gems, install them from the command line with +gem install+.

 $ gem install asciidoctor tilt haml

==== Backend and deck.js installation

. Download or +git clone+ the {backend-git}[Asciidoctor backends] repository.

 $ git clone git://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends.git

. Create a directory named +deck.js+ inside your working directory (i.e. where your AsciiDoc document resides).

. {deckjs-zip}[Download] and extract the deck.js archive or +git clone+ the {deckjs-git}[deck.js] repository into the +deck.js+ directory you created in step 2.

 $ git clone git://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js.git

. If you plan to split your slides, {decksplitjs-git}[download the +deck.split.js+ extension] and copy it into the +deck.js/extensions+ directory.

. If you want to use the fullscreen photo feature, create an +images+ directory in your working directory.

==== Deckjs backend attributes

There are a number of document attributes specific to the +deckjs+ backend.

.+deckjs+ backend document attributes
[cols="2,1,2m"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Example

|:backend: deckjs
|Activates the deck.js backend to render the document as a deck.js presentation
|:backend: deckjs

|:deckjs_theme: <theme>
|Sets the deck.js theme to neon, swiss or web-2.0
|:deckjs_theme: web-2.0

|:deckjs_transition: <type>
|Sets the transition style to horizontal-slide, vertical-slide or fade
|:deckjs_transition: fade

|:customjs: <javascript location>
|Sets a custom javascript file; can be used as a deck.js custom configuration
|:customjs: <javascript location>

|:customcss: <css location>
|Sets a custom css file
|:customcss: <css location>

|:menu:
|Toggle to and from a grid layout overview of all the slides by pressing the +m+ key
|:menu:

|:navigation:
|Renders clickable previous and next navigation icons on the slides
|:navigation:

|:status:
|Renders the current slide number and total number of slides
|:status:

|:split:
|Registers the split module for use in the document
|:split:
|===

NOTE: You can also specify a custom stylesheet using the +stylesheet+ attribute, which customizes AsciiDoc elements like section, paragraph, images, etc.

The attributes described in the table above are set in the header of your document.

.Header with +deckjs+ backend attributes
....
= Presentation Title
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:deckjs_theme: web-2.0
:deckjs_transition: horizontal-slide
:navigation:
....

==== Slide syntax examples

Structuring a slideshow and writing the slide content uses the same syntax as a typical AsciiDoc document, with a few added features.

Let's see some examples of the +deckjs+ backend features:

.Slide titles and background images
----
= Title of Presentation <1>
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:deckjs_transition: fade
:navigation:

== Title of Slide One <2>

This is the first slide after the title slide.

[canvas-image="images/example.jpg"] <3>
== Slide Two's Title will not be displayed <4>

[role="canvas-caption", position="center-up"] <5>
This text is displayed on top of the example.jpg image.
----
<1> The presentation title and author's name will be displayed on the title slide.
<2> Each new slide is designated by a level 1 section title (`==`).
<3> The +canvas-image+ attribute embeds a fullscreen image as a slide background. Position the attribute above the title of the slide you want the image applied to.
<4> When the +canvas-image+ attribute is applied to a slide, that slide's title will not be displayed.
<5> +canvas-caption+ applies a colored box around the caption text. +position+ specifies the location of the caption block (bottom-left, top-left, bottom-right, top-right, center-up, center-down)

.Stepped paragraphs, lists, and blocks
----
== Stepped paragraphs

[options="step"]
This paragraph is displayed first.

[options="step"]
Then this paragraph is displayed when the _Next_ arrow is clicked.

== Stepped list items

[options="step"]
* A bullet is displayed each time the _Next_ arrow is clicked.
* B
* C

== Stepped blocks

[options="step"]
----
Block one
----

[options="step"]
----
Block two
----
----

The +step+ option reveals each paragraph, bullet, etc. separately each time you click the _Next_ arrow.

WARNING: The original AsciiDoc +deckjs+ backend for the AsciiDoc processor used the option +incremental+ instead of +step+.
We've changed it to +step+ in order to save you some typing.

.Split
----
= Presentation Title
Presenter Name
:backend: deckjs
:split: <1>

== This Slide is Split

This Slide will act like

<<< <2>

three individual slides with the same title

<<<

once the document is rendered.
----
<1> To create multiple, consecutive slides with the same title, set the +split+ attribute in the document header.
<2> Then, within a slide, insert `<<<` to specify the slide breaks.

==== Rendering

To render your presentation as HTML5, execute the command:

 $ asciidoctor -T ../asciidoctor-backends/haml presentation.adoc

. The command +-T+ (+--template-dir+) tells the Asciidoctor processor to override the built-in backends.
. Directly after +-T+ is the path to where you saved or cloned the Asciidoctor backends repository containing the +deckjs+ backend (step 1 under the <<backend-and-deck-js-installation,installation section>>).

==== Storing multiple templates

Custom templates can be stored in multiple directories.
That means you can build on an existing backend by copying only the templates you want to modify.
Then, just pass both the directory holding the original templates and the directory containing your customized templates when you invoke Asciidoctor.

In the CLI, multiple template directories are specified by using the +-T+ option multiple times.

 $ asciidoctor -T /path/to/original/templates -T /path/to/modified/templates sample.adoc

In the API, multiple template directories are specified by passing an array to the +template_dirs+ option:

```ruby
Asciidoctor.convert_file 'sample.adoc', :safe => :safe, :in_place => true,
    :template_dirs => ['/path/to/original/templates', '/path/to/modified/templates']
```
