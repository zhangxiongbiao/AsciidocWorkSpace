I'm proud to announce the {repo-ref}[Asciidoctor Maven plugin] 0.1.3.1 release!
This is simply a bug fix release to correct some of the things I messed up with 0.1.3 (sorry about that).
Like version 0.1.3 before it, it's based on the same version of the {java-int-ref}[Asciidoctor Java integration] project and the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] projects -- 0.1.3.

Thank you to all the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/contributors[contributors] for helping out.

Go forth and make great documentation once again!
