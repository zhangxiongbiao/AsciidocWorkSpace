It has taken me a little while longer to get this release out the door than I would have hoped, but it's here at last!
I'm proud to release {repo-ref}[Asciidoctor Maven plugin] version 0.1.3!
Like the other versions before it, it is based on the same version of the {java-int-ref}[Asciidoctor Java integration] project and the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] projects -- 0.1.3.

There's very little new things for the end user in this release as the changes were mostly to use some of the new ease of use things from the Java Integration project. 

I would like to call out the help of https://github.com/bleathem[Brian Leathem] in this release in helping me go through a few things and pushing me to release it. Also, thank you to all the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/contributors[contributors] for helping out.

Go forth and make great documentation once again!
