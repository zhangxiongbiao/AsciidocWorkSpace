The long-awaited release of Asciidoctor 1.5.0 “Bleeding Heart” has arrived at last!
This release includes a stockpile of 150 fixes, improvements and enhancements as well as several refinements to the AsciiDoc syntax.
We're confident you're going to _love writing_ with Asciidoctor more than ever before.

Asciidoctor 1.5.0 is the sequel to 0.1.4.
We shifted the numbers to adopt a semantic versioning scheme and communicate that this release is well beyond stable.

[[migration-warning]]
== icon:warning[color=red] Please take note!

Before you upgrade to Asciidoctor 1.5.0, it's important to know we've introduced some changes to the AsciiDoc syntax that aren't backward compatible.
Don't panic, though!
We also introduced a compatibility mode.

Refer to the {uri-migrate}[migration guide] for information about the affected syntax and how to migrate (or prepare to migrate) your content.
By making these syntax changes, we're working to make AsciiDoc more consistent and easier to learn.

== Milestones & momentum

We closed https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues?q=milestone%3Av1.5.0[150 issues] during the Asciidoctor 1.5.0 development cycle.
At the time of the last release, we announced that Asciidoctor had reached 50,000 downloads from RubyGems.org.
This time around, we didn't just double the download count, we _quadrupled_ it!
Asciidoctor has now been downloaded more than 225,000 times at the time of this release!

It's not the download count of which we're most proud.
It's the community of <<Acknowledgments,awesome people>> icon:users[].
There are now over 50 contributors in the Asciidoctor ecosystem, and this release alone has received participation from nearly every person in this group!
If you haven't had a chance to participate in Asciidoctor, there's never been a better time to join in.

Here's a summary of the milestones we've crossed:

[.green]
* [x] 150 issues closed in 1.5.0
* [x] 50 total contributors
* [x] 225,000 total downloads
* [x] 1,800 total commits
* [x] 1,500 tests
* [x] 1000 total issues (including pull requests)
* [x] 800 issues closed in total (including pull requests)
* [x] 400 mailing list topics
* [x] 2 years of development (initial commit Jun 1, 2012)

This wouldn't be an Asciidoctor release announcement without discussing the speed of the processor.
The 1.5.0 release brings another _10% improvement_ in speed over the previous version.
To give you a picture of how fast it is now, the Spring Framework Reference Guide, weighing in at 50,000+ lines, renders to HTML in _1.15 seconds_ on an Asus ZenBook UX301LA using Ruby 2.1.

Asciidoctor is now in use by even more open source projects, including Groovy, Griffon, GroovyFX, Infinispan, Weld, Hibernate OGM, Spring Data and git-scm.com.
It's also used to produce NFJS, the Magazine.
Best of all, {uri-github}/graphitefriction[Sarah] has been hard at work filling in Asciidoctor's own {uri-manual}[user manual] and helping teams understand how to http://graphitefriction.com/decks[write better documentation^].

In case you didn't notice, the Asciidoctor project is on icon:fire[role=red].
On that note, let's get to what's in this new release!

I (Dan) would also like to thank *Sarah White* for her monstrous effort providing input into the software design, editing the user manual, updating the website, testing (read as: breaking) and establishing a documentation workflow for the project.
Asciidoctor would not be what it is today without her dedication.

Additional thanks to everyone who is using the project, advocating for better documentation and those who have participated in the growing ecosystem of sub-projects.

We're always eager to learn about your experiences and how we can help improve them.
Together, we're making documentation fun, easy, and rewarding!

== What's next?

This release is just the beginning of the release train.
Look for releases of AsciidoctorJ, Asciidoctor.js, the build plugins (Gradle and Maven), the Linux packages and more!

The next release of Asciidoctor will be the 1.5.1 point release.
From now on, we plan to iterate much faster and only do announcements for major and minor versions.

See the {uri-changelog}[CHANGELOG] for a complete list of changes.
