We're excited to announce the newest member of the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] family, {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet]. {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet] is a Javadoc Doclet based on {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] that enables developers to write Javadoc comments using the {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] syntax.

== Motivation

From the very beginning, a concept the designers of Java got right was to include documentation with source code. This allowed documentation to stay closer in sync with ever-changing source and allowed multiple viewing platforms, most notably the HTML generation and IDE integration.

The main drawback of Javadoc has been the requirement to use embedded HTML fragments to achieve advanced (or even modest) formatting. This is where the {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] integration shines. Being a lightweight markup language, {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] gives developers access to advanced formatting without having to fiddle with low-level HTML markup. In other words, developers can focus on _the content_ rather than _the markup_ and still achieve a beautiful end result.

Pairing AsciiDoc with Javadocs means readable source and beautifully rendered Javadocs, _the best of both worlds!_

== Usage

Once {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet] is plugged into Javadoc, it's just a matter of using {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] mark up in Javadocs. The following example demonstrates a number of features of {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet]:

[source,java]
--
/**
 * = Asciidoclet <1>
 *
 * Sample comments that include +source code+. <2>
 *
 * [source,java] <3>
 * --
 * public class Asciidoclet extends Doclet {
 *     private final Asciidoctor asciidoctor = Asciidoctor.Factory.create();
 *
 *     @SuppressWarnings("UnusedDeclaration") <4>
 *     public static boolean start(RootDoc rootDoc) {
 *         new Asciidoclet().render(rootDoc);
 *         return Standard.start(rootDoc);
 *     }
 * }
 * --
 *
 * @author https://github.com/johncarl81[John Ericksen] <5>

public class Asciidoclet extends Doclet {
}
--

<1> Titles are easy to create using the +=+ markup.
<2> Paragraphs are the default and do not require the +<p>+ html tag. Inline source may be marked up by surrounding the text in `+` symbols.
<3> Source is easily marked up using the +[source,language]+ tag and block delimiters, +--+, also called "fences"
<4> The notorious +@+ symbol is automatically handled by {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet], avoiding the standard +{@literal @}+ boilerplate.
<5> Inline {asciidoc-ref}[AsciiDoc] markup is available within Javadoc tags. This example highlights link rendering.

== Distribution

Asciidoclet is published to Maven Central. The artifact information is summarized in the table below.

{asterisk} This release is based on the Asciidoctor {artifact-version} release.

== Installation

{repo-ref}[Asciidoclet] is a standard Javadoc Doclet and may be used as such. One of the easiest ways to install {repo-ref}[Asciidoclet] is by adding it as a Doclet to the +maven-javadoc-plugin+:

We hope that this extension helps you push your Javadocs to new heights. As always, collaboration is welcome and you may find (and fork) the source on {repo-ref}[GitHub].

A big thanks to {gh-ref}/lordofthejars[Alex Soto] of the {aji-ref}[Asciidoctor Java integration project], {gh-ref}/lightguard[Jason Porter] and {gh-ref}/mojavelinux[Dan Allen] for their feedback and support and everyone else who contributes to the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] project. Writing this extension could not have been easier because of the great work and collaboration of the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] community.
