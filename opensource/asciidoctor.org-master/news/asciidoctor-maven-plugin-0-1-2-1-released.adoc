Some great things have happened for the {repo-ref}[Asciidoctor Maven plugin] since the last release, I'm happy to announce the release of version 0.1.2.1!

This release is still based upon the version 0.1.2 release of both the {java-int-ref}[Asciidoctor Java integration] project and the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] projects.
This release contains bug fixes and a couple of new features, but is still fully compatible with the 0.1.2 release.

Upgrading to 0.1.2.1 (recommended) is simple.
Just update the version in your Maven POM.
All necessary dependencies should be pulled in via Maven.
