AsciiDoc is an excellent tool for writing documentation, but there's simply not enough information about it.

Today, I'm excited to announce a new resource for AsciiDoc, http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org].
In addition to serving as the project page for the http://github.com/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor project] and its integrations, this website helps promote AsciiDoc through education and advocacy.

The key highlight of the site is a collection of new AsciiDoc guides:

- link:/docs/what-is-asciidoc-why-use-it/[What is AsciiDoc? Why do we need it?]
- link:/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]
- link:/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide]

The purpose of these guides is to answer your questions about AsciiDoc and get you familiar with the syntax quickly.
They present AsciiDoc by following a recommended set of conventions to help you create more consistent documents and maximize your writing productivity.

If you see a change you want to make, *contributing to the guides is easy!*

The guides are written in AsciiDoc and https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org[hosted on GitHub].
If you see a change you want to make in one of the guides, just look for the *Edit* button in the right-hand column and click on it.
That will take you to an editor on GitHub where you can make the change and submit it as a pull request.

Alternatively, you can clone the project, make the change locally, commit it, then send a pull request in the usual way.

Once the change is merged into the +master+ branch, it gets published automatically.

I hope you find the guides useful, and I look forward to your feedback.
Together, we can take the agony out of writing documentation!
